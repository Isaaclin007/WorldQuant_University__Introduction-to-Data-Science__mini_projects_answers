The first step in defining most classes is to define their __init__ and __repr__ methods so that we can construct and represent distinct objects of that class. Our Point class should accept two arguments, x and y, and be represented by a string 'Point(x, y)' with appropriate values for x and y.

When you've written a Point class capable of this, execute the cell with grader.score for this question (do not edit that cell; you only need to modify the Point class).

class Point(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Point(%d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y)
p = Point(1, 2)
p
